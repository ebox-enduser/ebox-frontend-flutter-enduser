# eBox is an e-commerce app that helps grocery stores sell ready-to-cook meal kits to people on various diets. Therefore, we created this app to serve customers like regular people, women, kids, and patients. To recover and avoid the negative things below:
- Undernutrition costs us up to 430M (USD)
- 18% are overweight
- 14% are underweight
- 32% are stunted
- 10% suffer from wasting
- NCDs caused 56% of deaths in Cambodia
# We made this app in order to maintain our health and prevent illness.
